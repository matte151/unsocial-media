# Unsocial Media

Unsocial Media is a tool to assist individuals, and psychiatrists to get off of social media.  It's like a vape pen for social media, but hopefully much more helpful, and much less harmful.

## Features

- Looks like something familiar to give you that sensation that you're wasting your time in a way that is comfortable to you.
- Includes random likes values so that you think you're super important and popular.  WOW SO MANY LIKES?!?!
- Only shows your own posts, because you should mind your own business!
- Can have friends, they don't have to accept you, you can be friends with whoever you want... please do check in with your therapist regarding these choices.
- Cannot unfriend people.  That's not how friends work, that's so weird... If you're fighting, that's ok.  Call them, have a beer, work your stuff out.
